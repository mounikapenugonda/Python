1.	Perform the following operations in sim_int so as to calculate the simple interest –
    a.	In the variables p,n,r get the input from the user so as to get the principal amount, time, and rate of the interest from the user.
    b.	In the variable si perform operations in order to calculate the simple interest. Hint – The formula for calculating simple interest is – (Principal amount * time * rate)/100.
    c.	Display the simple interest value stored in variable si and also display all the objects defined in the current namespaces.
